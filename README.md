# Team-Profile-Generator

## Description:

* This website is designed to help organizations to automatically generate a team-profile website by entering a set of terminal commands.
* This project was completed based on the Node.js and OOP(object oriented programming) concepts, the fs modules, and 3rd-party npm library-inquirer, and sucessfully tested using npm jest.
* I have learned the ways to work at the back-end of javaScript development using node.js, by running the program in the command window(Git Bash Shell). At the meantime, running testings for the classes.
* Cation: Welcome to the back-end environment! You need to clone the repo && install the npm inquirer before you can experience this application.
* For testing purposes: You need to install jest by entering `npm install --save-dev jest` in the terminal/gitbash shell.
